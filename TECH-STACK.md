<details>
  <summary>Info</summary>
  
  #### What
The above list are projects I've built categorised by language / tech stack.

#### Why
I feel uncomfortable saying that I have experience with a certain technology, if I don't have anything to show for it. So this list acts as a reference I can use to show examples of code I've written with a given language or tech stack. And that means the list of skills I put on my CV is not completely basless. 

#### How
The list is generated with GH actions, using [gleich/profile_stack](https://github.com/gleich/profile_stack).

#### Where
Everything I do in my own time is published on my GitHub.
I've obviously worked on many projects which can't be listed above, since they were done on a contract and are not open source.
